												Personal Loan via Banks/NBFCs
											</h2>
											<p class="text-gray-600 mt-1 text-sm md:text-base">
												Some banks cater to new-to-credit customers and start with a smaller loan amount. The key to getting a loan here is a job in an established company, a good salary and a healthy bank balance. The second category are those borrower who every bank would want to give a loan to or in fact a higher loan. However, other criteria like your salary, your debt to income ratio, credit card outstanding, house type,  etc will also play a very critical role. The chance of a borrower with a loan Cibil score and multiple delays getting a loan is very bleak. However, a borrower with a low Cibil score and a few delays can still salvage the situation by ensure proper repayment of existing line of credit. There are a few banks and NBFCs which help in improving the credit score by various means such as a secured line of credit and more. Multiple banks and NBFCs are continuously fighting for market share to ensure better revenues and an asset class to leverage upon.
